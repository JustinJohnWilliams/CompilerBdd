-----------------------

Using the language you chose for the project, design and implement a
data type called "Position" that can be used to store information about
the name of an input file, the number of a line in that file (starting
at 1), and the position ("column") on that line (starting at 0).

Implement the following operations:

   * Create and initialise a position.

   * Increment the column of a position.

   * Increment the line of a position (resetting the column to 0).

   * Create a copy of a position.

   * Show a position on the provided output stream, in a format
     exemplified by the following:

     file_name:12:4:

     Note that the final colon should be followed by a single space.


NOTE: You will have to create many positions, so when you copy a
      position it is important for the two copies to share the same
      representation of the file name.
